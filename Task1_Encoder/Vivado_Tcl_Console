I have written and simulated this code using Vivado. Below, Iâ€™ve attached the Tcl Console output along with the simulated waveforms. 


                   0 the input = 00001000 which is encoded as output = 000
                  15 the input = 01000000 which is encoded as output = 110
                  25 the input = 00000100 which is encoded as output = 010
                  35 the input = 01010000 which is encoded as output = 110      
                  45 the input = 00000001 which is encoded as output = 000
                  55 the input = 00000010 which is encoded as output = 001
                  65 the input = 00001100 which is encoded as output = 011
                  75 the input = 00010000 which is encoded as output = 100
                  85 the input = 00101001 which is encoded as output = 101
                  95 the input = 10000000 which is encoded as output = 111
                 105 the input = 00000010 which is encoded as output = 001
                 115 the input = 00000100 which is encoded as output = 010
